#Write a program that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root.

#You should create a function called <tt>sqrt</tt> that does this.

#I am asking you to create your own sqrt function and not to use the built in functions x ** .5 or math.sqrt(x).

#I suggest that you look at the newton method at estimating square roots.
#Please enter a positive number: 14.5
#The square root of 14.5 is approx. 3.8.
